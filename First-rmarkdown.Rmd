Hello, this is Noel and Jacob Computing II Project

The main purpose of our project is to make a program is we will use a Jupyter notebook to determine the propotion of adeonine in a genectic sequence that are in FASTA format and compare the metabolic rate based on weight in diffrent animals. The program is also used to calculate the amount of A in the entire sequence. We plan to record our data in in a tidy format.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
