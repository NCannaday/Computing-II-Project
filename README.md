# Computing-II-Project
Hello, this is Noel and Jacob Computing II Project


The main purpose of our project is to make a program is we will use a Jupyter notebook to determine the propotion of adeonine in a genectic sequence that are in FASTA format and compare the metabolic rate based on weight in diffrent animals. The program is also used to calculate the amount of A in the entire sequence.
We plan to record our data in csc file in a tidy format.
