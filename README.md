# Computing-II-Project
Hello, this is Noel and Jacob Computing II Project


The main purpose of our project is to make a program that will use a formula based on the absorbance/color of pond water to determine different levels of a chemical.
We plan on using an R notebook, and we plan on using the statistical analysis based in R.
We plan to record our data in csc file in a tidy format.
